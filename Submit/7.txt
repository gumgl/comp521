My game is p-pointless for a finite p. If the player shoots a bullet with color X and it does not hit the door of same color X, he cannot pick it up to shoot again and no other bullet of that color is available. In that case the player is not able to open any more door and therefore cannot get to the other end of the maze and win. But the game does not end, player can still walk around the maze.
A value for p could be 8: player picks up bullet and shoots corresponding door for all 4 bullets, but for the last one it does not hit the door. Afterwards it is pointless to stay in the game.
