My strategy:
We know that the user must go through all 4 rooms. Also we only have 1 projectile per room, and each secondary room takes on projectile to access it. So the last room must also contain the projectile for it.
Knowing this, I simply shuffle the room sets {A,B,C} to obtain a sequence/order that the player needs to unlock doors.
I then place the projectile for the 1st secondary room in the start room.
Same for the projectile for the 2nd secondary room in the 1st secondary room.
Same for the projectile for the 3rd secondary room in the 2nd secondary room.
And finally, the projectile to exit the 3rd (and last) secondary room in that room (3rd secondary room).
This way the player needs to follow this sequence.
